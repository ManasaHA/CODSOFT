# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

## Introduction
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)contains the following features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Results
- Model accuracy: X%
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated for further evaluation.
