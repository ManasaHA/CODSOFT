# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

## Introduction
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one target variable (species). The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)contains the following features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Results
- Model accuracy: X%
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated for further evaluation.
