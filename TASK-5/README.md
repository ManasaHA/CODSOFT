# Task - 5
# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task in the financial sector, where identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions can save billions of dollars. This project aims to develop a robust model to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.
This project builds a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It covers data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalization.
- Class Imbalance Handling: Oversampling and undersampling.
- Model Training: Logistic Regression and Random Forests.
- Model Evaluation: Precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like oversampling and undersampling have been applied to improve the model's results, ensuring a balanced and accurate detection of fraudulent transactions.
