# Movie Rating Prediction

This project aims to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, we develop a regression model that accurately estimates movie ratings given by users or critics. This project allows exploration of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies) and includes historical data of movies with the following features:
- Name
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Year
- Results
- Ratings

## Modeling
We use regression techniques to build the prediction model. Example algorithms include:
- Ridge Regression
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Cross-validation is used to ensure the model's robustness.

## Results
The final model's performance and key insights are presented. We discuss the factors that most influence movie ratings and the model's accuracy.
