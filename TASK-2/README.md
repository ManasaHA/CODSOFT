# Movie Rating Prediction

This project aims to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. By analyzing historical movie data, we develop a regression model that accurately estimates movie ratings given by users or critics. This project allows exploration of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict movie ratings using various features such as genre, director, and actors. By leveraging historical movie data, we build a regression model that can estimate the ratings of movies. This provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes historical data of movies with the following features:
- Title
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Release Year
- Runtime
- Ratings (from users and critics)

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-prediction.git
    cd movie-rating-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., genre, director, actors)
- Normalizing/standardizing numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the data distributions, correlations, and patterns. Visualizations and statistical summaries help in gaining insights into the dataset.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering includes creating meaningful features from the raw data. Examples include:
- One-hot encoding of genres
- Aggregating actor and director information
- Creating interaction features between different variables

## Modeling

We use regression techniques to build the prediction model. Example algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Cross-validation is used to ensure the model's robustness.

## Results

The final model's performance and key insights are presented. We discuss the factors that most influence movie ratings and the model's accuracy.
