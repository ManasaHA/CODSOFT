TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION 

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

SOLUTION :
Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Model
The model used for this project is a Logistic Regression classifier ,Random Forest, are used for comparing the performance.

Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
